# Background
As the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district, you will assist the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. Your first task is to analyze district-wide standardized test results. You will have access to every student's math and reading scores, along with various information about the schools they attend. Your goal is to aggregate the data to identify obvious trends in school performance. 

# Instructions 
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data:
1. District Summary: Perform calculations and create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, including total schools, total students, total budget, average math score, average reading score, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall.
2. School Summary: Perform calculations and create a summary of key metrics for each school, including school name, school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math score, average reading score, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall.
3. Top Performing Schools: Identify the top 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate.
4. Bottom Performing Schools: Identify the bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate.
5. Math Scores by Grade: Create a table that showcases the average math score for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
6. Reading Scores by Grade: Create a table that showcases the average reading score for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
7. Scores by School Spending: Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student.
8. Scores by School Size: Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, large).
9. Scores by School Type: Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school type (Charter vs. District).

# Analysis
My report includes a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data. This can be found at the top of the code.
